# Contributing to CodeCompanion.nvim

Thank you for considering a contribution to this project!

Before contributing a PR, please open up a discussion to talk about it further. Whilst I welcome contributions that improve the plugin, I want to refrain from adding features that will add very little value and a lot of bloat.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. Add your feature or fix to your branch.
3. Ensure your code follows the project's coding style and conventions.
4. Make sure your code has adequate test coverage and is well-documented.
5. Open a pull request (PR) with a clear title and description.

## Guidelines

- **Feature Requests**: I encourage you to suggest new features! However, please note that I will only add features that align with my own personal workflow.
- **Bug Fixes**: If you're submitting a PR to address a bug, please ensure you've raised this as an issue that I can test.
- **Responsibility**: If you add a feature, you are responsible for maintaining and bug fixing that feature going forward. The maintainers may provide guidance and support, but ultimate responsibility lies with the contributor.
- **Code Quality**: I strive to maintain high code quality. Please ensure that your PR has corresponding tests.
- **Communication**: If you have any questions or need clarification, feel free to open an issue or reach out to the maintainers.
