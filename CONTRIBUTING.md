# Contributing to CodeCompanion.nvim

Thank you for considering a contribution to this project!

Before contributing a PR, please open up a discussion to talk about it further. Whilst I welcome contributions that improve the plugin, I want to refrain from adding features that will add very little value and muchos bloat...LLMs and their vision capability for example.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. Add your feature or fix to your branch.
3. Ensure your code follows the project's coding style and conventions.
4. Make sure your code is well-documented.
5. Open a pull request (PR) with a clear title and description.

## Guidelines

* **Feature Requests**: I encourage you to suggest new features! However, please note that I will only add features that align with my own personal workflow.
* **Bug Fixes**: If you're submitting a PR to address a bug, please include a detailed description of the issue and the steps to reproduce it.
* **Responsibility**: If you add a feature, you are responsible for maintaining and bug fixing that feature going forward. The maintainers may provide guidance and support, but ultimate responsibility lies with the contributor.
* **Code Quality**: I strive to maintain high code quality. Please ensure that your code is well-tested and does not introduce any regressions.
* **Communication**: If you have any questions or need clarification, feel free to open an issue or reach out to the maintainers.
